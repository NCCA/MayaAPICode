# Maya API demos used in Lectures

The lecture notes to accompany this code are here https://nccastaff.bournemouth.ac.uk/jmacey/MayaAPI/ 

The code will work using the Qt projects for Linux and Mac and just require the Maya Devkit to be installed in an appropriate location. The dev kits are located here https://www.autodesk.com/developer-network/platform-technologies/maya and are now not part of the default maya install.

For windows build follow the instructions here https://nccastaff.bournemouth.ac.uk/jmacey/MayaAPI/Windows/index.md.html.

Each project has an MSbuild project which can be used.
