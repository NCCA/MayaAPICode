# TriangleNodeLocator

This is my attempt as the smallest Viewport 2.0 locator node, to help untangle some of the mess that is the footprintManip demo (from Autodesk).

This demo draws a simple Triangle with colours at each vertex and normals. It also has data for line (wireframe) and a single solid triangle.

This is the basis of demos to create more complex meshes with viewport 2.0
